# SASS-mixin-library
This is a very tiny mixin library that i'm used to need. I try to keep it simple and short. It must be composed of generic mixins only.

General functions:

    - multibrowser: Given a $property and its $value, it prints every multibrowser prefixes.
    
Specific functions:

    - border-radius: Provides a multibrowser support with optional border-radius parameters.
    - simple-transition: A simple transition with multibrowser support, used as the multiple-transition base case.
    - multiple-transition: A multibrowser transition mixin with multiple values support.

Other functions (Discussed if will still be here in the future):

    - user-select: user-select with multibrowser support.
